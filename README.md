# Web Thing API

This specification describes the current data model and API used by the [WebThings](http://webthings.io) IoT platform.

You can view a rendered version [here](http://webthings.io/api).

Note that the Web Thing Description section of this specification is currently being [standardised](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) by the [W3C Web of Things Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/) and the Web Thing REST API and Web Thing WebSocket API sections are being standardised by the [W3C Web Thing Protocol Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/web-thing-protocol/). This specification started as a draft W3C member submission by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org), but continues to be maintained to document the API currently implemented by the [WebThings](https://webthings.io) IoT platform while it converges with the W3C standards as they mature.
